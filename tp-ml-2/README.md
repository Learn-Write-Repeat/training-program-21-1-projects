#### About Project 

Human Activity Recognition, or HAR for short, is the problem of predicting what a person is doing based on a trace of their movement using sensors.Movements are often normal indoor activities such as standing, sitting, jumping, and going up stairs.Sensors are often located on the subject, such as a smartphone or vest, and often record accelerometer data in three dimensions (x, y, z).It was prepared and made available by Davide Anguita, et al. from the University of Genova, Italy and is described in full in their 2013 paper “A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.” The dataset was modeled with machine learning algorithms in their 2012 paper titled “Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine.

#### Workflow
Load Data
Visualise the dataset
Approach to Modeling
Classify Activities
we have shared each task and worked as a team efficiently
